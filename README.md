## Project Description

HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is one of the worldâ€™s most serious public health challenges. There were approximately 38.4 million people across the globe with HIV in 2020. Of these, 36.7 million were adults and 1.7 million were children (<15 years old). In addition, 54% were women and girls. 

As an HIV-positive person, dating can be challenging as you want to find love, but maintain privacy about your status so you can live a happy and stress-free life with your prospective partner. This project is a dating application spoecifically for people living with HIV to get to know themselves, share feelings, messages and love. However, this is a portfolio project and not a project meant for commercial purposes. It's a project aimed at strenthening my capacity to write Ruby on Rails code.
