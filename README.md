## Project Description

HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is one of the worldâ€™s most serious public health challenges. There were approximately 38.4 million people across the globe with HIV in 2020. Of these, 36.7 million were adults and 1.7 million were children (<15 years old). In addition, 54% were women and girls. 

As an HIV-positive person, dating can be challenging as you want to find love, but maintain privacy about your status so you can live a happy and stress-free life with your prospective partner. This is a dating application to be built using Rails technology. The aim of this project is strictly for learning purposes and at the end of the project, it's expected that:

1. I know how to apply technical knowledge and skills in a complex project.
2. I should understand pros and cons of different approaches of working with Ruby on Rails.
3. I should understand the principles of Ruby on Rails to aid my job search.
4. I should be able to apply Ruby best practices and language style guides in code etc
